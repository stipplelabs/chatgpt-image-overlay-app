üåü Discover the fantastic potential of ChatGPT API with my ChatGPT Image Overlay App! I've leveraged OpenAI's ChatGPT to harness the incredible capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT to create image overlays with simple, natural language commands. This demo demonstrates the power of GPT-3.5 in creating intelligent, dynamic, responsive applications that can learn and adapt to user input while accounting for the inherent randomness of AI models.

### Prerequisite

Leveraging API calls to LLM for quickly building software applications with conversational interfaces still needs to be appreciated. Go through the course https://deeplearning.ai/short-courses/chatgpt-prompt-engineering-for-developers/ created by [@AndrewYNg](https://twitter.com/AndrewYNg) and [@OpenAI](https://twitter.com/OpenAI) to learn more about the ChatGPT prompt engineering process.


### Installation
- Clone this repo
- Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed
- Create virtual env: \
  python3 -m venv chatgpt-overlay-env
- Activate the env: \
  source chatgpt-overlay-env/bin/activate
- Install all required packages: \
  pip3 install -r requirements.txt
- Check installed packages: pip3 list
- Setup OpenAI account and set environment variables for OpenAPI Key as defined \
  in https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5112595-best-practices-for-api-key-safety \
  Code fetches the OpenAPI Key using os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"]. \
  Please see the code in service/open_api_service.py for more details.  
- Run the Streamlit app locally: \
  streamlit run app.py\
  You can now view your Streamlit app in your browser.\
  Local URL: http://localhost:8501

  Use prompt/user.test.prompts to test the app before your wild exploration!
